What I see every day is people creating pieces of paper to take into a room for people to look at and decide if they like that piece of paper, and if they don’t _totally_ like it they say what they would prefer to see on that piece of paper.

This repeats until everybody is happy with a piece of paper.

**The Systems Thinking Lesson**

Nobody cares about the piece of paper once everybody is happy with it.
There is no checking that these pieces of paper did what everybody wanted them to do. No learning takes place, the life cycle is complete once 100% happiness is achieved.

The purpose of  a policy officer is to write essays for the senior leadership team to mark.
