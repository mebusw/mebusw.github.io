Rugby(英式橄榄球)运动是1845年开始的。Scrum方法创始人们是读了1986年HBR论文《The New New Product Development Game》而受到了Rugby运动的启发，并在1995年发布论文，正式提出Scrum方法。论文链接见：http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.86.4164 或 http://jeffsutherland.com/oopsla/schwapub.pdf

Scrum是Agile敏捷开发方法的一个流派，Sprint一词（英文原意是Rugby运动中的短距离冲刺）是1995年Scrum一词（英文原意是Rugby运动中的争球）创立者为了区别于其他增量迭代式开发(IID)方法（例如 XP极限编程方法），而从Rugby运动借来的比喻，意为一个短的时间盒，期望每个时间盒末尾能有潜在可交付的产品增量以供反馈和调整。

如今敏捷行业，Iteration和Sprint几乎混在一起使用了，甚至包括一些新兴的精益产品创新方法如谷歌的Design Sprint一词也效仿设计了5天的固定时间盒。

在中文世界，“迭代”一词有着不同的理解，有人理解为产品升级换代之意，也有人理解为一次产品的发版。所以在敏捷上下文中，特别是Scrum中，我们倾向于不翻译Sprint这个词，而像Scrum一样保留使用英文单词。
