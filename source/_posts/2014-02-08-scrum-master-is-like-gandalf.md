本文是之前为Scrum Gathering2013准备[《甘道夫--中土世界的Scrum Master》](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1dDXVX1v)话题时总结的一些想法，更多是从内部做SM时的体会。

SM是新的角色，很多时候定位不是那么清楚。The Scrum Master is primarily responsible for "How" - using Scrum the right way.

<!--more-->
## 先驱们关于SM的定义不外乎：
*   Ken Schwaber's discovery: “A _dead Scrum Master_ is a useless Scrum Master.”
*   "A SM should know what to do, but more important is what should not do"
*   "We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it."

而这里还应该加上一句：
**"Survival the new Role", "Fill the gap"**
SM即是内部转型的教练，同时也承担着来自"Delivery Success"的压力与动力

## 个人对SM的一些体会

如果SM同时兼任团队的team lead等职责，恐怕还有更多要做的事情，比如team building/people grow等:

1.  expectation gap from diffrerent people: coach for agile, info radar, technical, communication
2.  spread agile as evangelist
3.  manage regulation risk / personal risk for "innovation ideas": install SW, new devices
4.  as per PO:
    1.  is PO in same org as team and SM?
    2.  remind to inlucde all tasks into PB
    3.  remind to inlucde all NFR into PB / DoD
    4.  **keep sprint rhythem even if sprint is fali**
5.  as per Manager
    1.  **when asked to do thing instead of team**
    2.  **private decisions about e.g. resource (esp.  dual reporting lines)**
    3.  find expectation other than PO
    4.  managing style gap: C&C vs. empowerment
6.  as per Teams:
    1.  self-org: remind, coach, say no, group email
    2.  cross-team/site gap:  SoS, CI notification
    3.  technology / tools gap:  jenkins/Robot/nodejs
    4.  practices: CI, unit test, ATDD, CSD
7.  Others in organization:
    1.  adapt waterfall process (of other org) and solve env issue (delegate PjM)
    2.  coodination on depedencies (technical) and even mock them
    3.  work with infra / PSS / SCM
8.  Acheivement
    1.  by seeing team's working agreements
    2.  team's conversation and take responsibilites /actions in retrospective
    3.  others' feedback
    4.  self-org scrum team may happen after 6~12 month, be patient
9.  external vs. internal coach
