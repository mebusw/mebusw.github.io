你可能没有意识到，但是当你购买敏捷教练（特别是企业级教练）时，你所购买的是他们带来自己方式、他们的理智、他们的自制、他们的意义建构、以及他们的人性。正是由于很少人能带来那些东西，所以你值得付出—————金钱，以及（暂时性）的迷失方向和一定程度的不舒适，而这些将最终转化为舒适。你购买的是种子，这些种子会为你的组织赋予人性。

"You may not realize this, but when you pay an agile coach (especially an enterprise coach), you're paying for the way they bring themselves, their consciousness, their self-mastery, their sense-making, and their humanity to your organization. And because it is so rare for people to bring these things, it's going to cost you - both in terms of money, and in terms of (temporary) disorientation and a certain discomfort, which will eventually turn to comfort. You're paying for the seed to humanize your organization.”  - Posted on LinkedIn by Oluf Nissen
